This is a automated pipeline for RNA-seq processing samples from GEO based on my pyrnatools package. ChIP-seq processing may be added later.

The pipeline is as follows:
1. Download .soft file from GEO. This contains the sample information.
2. Download SRA files
3. Pyrnatools takes over here:
	1. FASTQC
	2. Cutadapt if necessary
	3. Tophat2
	4. Count genes
4. Delete unnecessary files
5. Upload useful files to webserver so they can be displayed on website #Not yet implemented
6. Assess quality of experiment?
7. Update database if supplied
