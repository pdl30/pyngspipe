Combining pyrnatools with a custom pipeline for a new compendium
Need to create simple sqlite database for required information and easy display to website

1. Download from GEO one at a time
2. Run infer_experiment.py for finding experiment type
3. Pyrnatools takes over here:
	1. FASTQC
	2. Cutadapt if necessary
	3. Tophat2
	4. Select uniquely mapped reads
	5. Convert to BED 
	6. Convert to bw
	7. Count genes
4. Delete unnecessary files
5. Upload useful files to tobias so they can be displayed on website
6. Assess quality of experiment?
7. Update database
