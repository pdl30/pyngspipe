This is a automated pipeline for processing RNA-seq and ChIP-seq samples from GEO based on my pyrnatools and pychiptools packages.

The pipeline is as follows:
1. Download .soft file from GEO. This contains the sample information.
2. Download SRA files
If RNA-seq:
3. Pyrnatools takes over here:
	1. FASTQC
	2. Cutadapt if necessary
	3. Tophat2
	4. Count genes
And if ChIP-seq:
3. Pychiptools will:	
        1. FASTQC
        2. Cutadapt if necessary
        3. Bowtie1/Bowtie2 based on genomes
        4. Make a bigWig
4. Delete unnecessary files
5. Upload useful files to webserver so they can be displayed on website #Not yet implemented
6. Assess quality of experiment?
7. Update database if supplied
